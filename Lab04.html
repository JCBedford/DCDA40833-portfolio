            <h2>Reflection and Analysis</h2>

            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                When I first uploaded the dataset into Tableau Public, I encountered several formatting issues. Some crime rate 
                columns were automatically classified as text rather than numeric measures, which prevented me from creating 
                histograms and properly sorting the top ten states in a bar chart. I manually adjusted the data types within the 
                data source tab to ensure the fields were treated as numeric measures. I also reviewed column headers for 
                consistency and filtered the dataset to focus on the most recent year when building the state comparison. After 
                these adjustments, the dataset functioned correctly and allowed for smooth visualization development. Also, when 
                posting my visualizations, I first made it into a dashboard. but I found that the dashboard was not working when I 
                posted it, so I had to post the visualizations separately.
            </p>

            <h3>Design Choices</h3>
            <p>
                I created three primary visualizations to examine crime patterns from multiple analytical angles. First, I built 
                a line graph showing the trend of crime rates over time. I used year as the dimension and crime rate as the 
                measure in order to identify long term increases or decreases. A line graph was the most appropriate choice 
                because it clearly displays temporal change and allows for easy identification of peaks, declines, and overall 
                trajectory. This visualization provides historical context and establishes whether crime trends are stable, 
                increasing, or decreasing over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the time trend, I created two bar charts to examine state level differences. The first bar chart 
                displays the top ten states with the highest violent crime rates. I used state as the dimension and violent crime 
                rate as the measure. This makes geographic concentration immediately visible.
                
                The second bar chart compares those same ten states using property crime rates. By holding the states constant 
                and changing the measure, I was able to compare whether states with high violent crime also experience similarly 
                high property crime. This comparative structure allows for a clearer analysis of whether different types of crime 
                cluster together or diverge across states. Together, these three visualizations move from national trends to state 
                level concentration and then to cross crime comparison.
            </p>

            <h3>Expected Patterns</h3>
            <p>
                Based on prior knowledge of crime trends, I expected property crime rates to be higher than violent crime rates 
                across states. The visualizations confirmed this expectation, as property crime values were consistently larger. 
                I also anticipated that the crime trend would look the way it does. It is concurrent with the rise of the war on drugs 
                which is a prominent piece of history taught in many criminal justice courses. The line graph shows a significant increase 
                in crime rates starting in the late 1970s, peaking in the early 1990s, and then declining steadily through the 2000s. This 
                pattern aligns with the historical context of drug-related crime and subsequent policy responses.
            </p>

            <h3>Surprises and Outliers</h3>
            <p>
                One notable surprise was the degree of variation within the top ten states. Although I expected differences, the 
                gap between the highest and lowest states in that group was more substantial than anticipated. Additionally, the 
                violent crime bar chart showed tighter clustering among most states than I initially expected, suggesting that 
                extreme cases may receive disproportionate public attention compared to their statistical frequency. The property 
                crime distribution was also more concentrated than predicted.
            </p>

            <h3>Questions for Further Investigation</h3>
            <p>
                These patterns raise important questions. What socioeconomic or structural factors contribute to states that 
                consistently rank highest in violent crime? How do reporting standards influence cross state comparisons? Would 
                incorporating variables such as poverty rates, urbanization levels, or educational attainment shift the 
                interpretation of these patterns? A longitudinal analysis could also reveal whether rankings remain stable over 
                time or fluctuate significantly.
            </p>

            <h3>Tool Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                I have used Tableau once before in my Data Analysis and Visualization course, and while I was able to use it in more detail 
                this time, I still found it to be a user-friendly tool for creating interactive visualizations. 
                Tableau Public proved to be an effective tool for exploratory analysis. Its drag and drop interface allowed me to 
                quickly test different measures and dimensions, while the dashboard feature enabled me to combine multiple 
                visualizations into a cohesive presentation. However, data cleaning options are limited compared to tools like R 
                or Python, and advanced statistical analysis is not easily integrated. Despite these limitations, Tableau excels at 
                rapid pattern identification and professional presentation, making it well suited for exploratory visualization and 
                portfolio development.
