            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                For this lab, I explored two AI tools from different categories: ChatGPT, a general-purpose
                text-based AI assistant I have used before, and NotebookLM, an AI research and note-analysis
                tool that was new to me. I chose these tools to better understand how AI can support both
                writing and research processes in academic work. Together, they demonstrate different
                approaches to AI assistance: one focused on generating content and the other on working
                directly with user-provided sources, which is especially relevant within the Digital Culture
                and Data Analytics (DCDA) program.

            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT performs well at generating and organizing text, making it useful for brainstorming,
                outlining, and drafting academic reflections. When prompts are specific, it can clearly
                explain concepts, rephrase ideas, and help structure longer assignments. For example, I used
                ChatGPT to organize reflections and clarify assignment expectations. However, the quality of
                its output depends heavily on the prompt. Vague prompts often lead to generic responses, and
                the tool can occasionally provide information that sounds confident but is inaccurate.
            </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT is best suited for early-stage writing, idea generation, and revision support. It
                works well as part of a workflow where the user maintains control over interpretation and
                final writing. It would be inappropriate to rely on ChatGPT to produce final academic work
                without revision, citation, or disclosure. Used responsibly, it enhances productivity
                without replacing human judgment.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT is trained on a mixture of licensed data, human-created data, and publicly available
                text, which raises concerns about bias and representation. Its outputs may reflect dominant
                cultural perspectives while overlooking marginalized voices. Ethical use requires
                transparency about AI assistance, careful fact-checking, and original engagement with course
                materials.

            <h2>Tool 2: NotebookLM</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
                NotebookLM is designed to analyze and respond to user-uploaded sources such as articles,
                PDFs, or notes. Its strongest feature is its ability to summarize and synthesize information
                based only on the provided materials. I found it effective for identifying key themes,
                clarifying relationships between concepts, and generating study-focused summaries. However,
                its effectiveness is limited by the quality and scope of the uploaded sources.
            </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                NotebookLM is well-suited for studying, research preparation, and organizing complex readings.
                It works best as a supplement to close reading rather than a replacement for it. A poor use
                case would be relying on NotebookLM summaries without engaging directly with the original
                sources, which could lead to a shallow understanding of the material.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                Because NotebookLM relies on user-provided documents, it avoids some intellectual property
                concerns associated with scraping external content. However, users must still ensure proper
                citation of original sources and disclose AI assistance when appropriate. Bias can also be
                introduced through selective source choice, making human judgment critical.

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                In my academic and professional work, I see AI tools as supports for organization, research
                synthesis, and early drafting rather than replacements for original thinking. In the DCDA
                context, tools like ChatGPT and NotebookLM can increase efficiency and accessibility, but
                they also require stronger critical evaluation skills. As we discussed in our Human Centered AI
                course, AI tools should be used thoughtfully and ethically, and it is critical that we do not let
                it replace essential human skills like critical thinking and cultural analysis. While AI can assist
                 with summarizing information and identifying patterns, uniquely human skills, such as ethical reasoning,
                contextual understanding, and critical cultural analysis remain essential. As AI tools
                continue to evolve, important questions include what data informs the tool, how transparent
                its processes are, and how its use shapes learning rather than shortcuts it.
